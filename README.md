# masked-autoencoders-cows

This repository contains the code used in my final graduation project, which involves using masked autoencoders as feature extractors for bovine images. It is divided into several notebooks.

## Notebooks

### pretraining
Responsible for the model's pre-training.

### feature_extractor
Uses the model's encoder to create latent variables corresponding to the images.
